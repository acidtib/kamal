# SSHKit
#
# [SSHKit](https://github.com/capistrano/sshkit) is the SSH toolkit used by Kamal.
#
# The default settings should be sufficient for most use cases, but
# when connecting to a large number of hosts you may need to adjust

# SSHKit options
#
# The options are specified under the sshkit key in the configuration file.
sshkit:

  # Max concurrent starts
  #
  # Creating SSH connections concurrently can be an issue when deploying to many servers.
  # By default Kamal will limit concurrent connection starts to 30 at a time.
  max_concurrent_starts: 10

  # Pool idle timeout
  #
  # Kamal sets a long idle timeout of 900 seconds on connections to try to avoid
  # re-connection storms after an idle period, like building an image or waiting for CI.
  pool_idle_timeout: 300

  # Keys Only
  #
  # Set to true to use only private keys from keys and key_data parameters, 
  # even if ssh-agent offers more identities. This option is intended for 
  # situations where ssh-agent offers many different identites or you have 
  # a need to overwrite all identites and force a single one.
  keys_only: false

  # Keys
  #
  # An array of file names of private keys to use for publickey
  # and hostbased authentication
  keys: []

  # Key Data
  #
  # An array of strings, with each element of the array being
  # a raw private key in PEM format.
  key_data: []
